# A Starter app for the Dashboard

This is just to demonstrate that it's possible to use laravel to create the api for a react frontend.
I tried to connect the laravel app to a mysql database, but didn't manage to do it. 
I would need to do a lot more reading to get that configurations right, but I assume you'd know a lot more about it than I do! 

I'd like to eventually dockerize all of this but I think we'll play it by ear.
